HammerJS Build and Installation Instructions
--------------------------------------------

Tip: If you are on a multicore system (like any modern computer these days),
you can speed up the build by passing an extra argument to the make command:

    make -j4

where 4 denotes the number of simultaneous compiles.

Mac OS X
========

Ensure that the development tools are ready to use, i.e. by installing
Xcode 3.2 or later, see http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/.

Run the following:

    ./configure
    make

To install to /usr/local/bin (requires Administrator password):

    sudo make install

Alternatively copy hammerjs executable to a directory in the PATH, e.g ~/bin.

Tip: For a faster initial build, install CMake 2.6 or later. Go to
www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html to get the binary package.

If system-wide CMake is available, the configure script will use it.
Otherwise it will download and build a local CMake.

Linux
=====

Ensure that the development tools, e.g. compilers and libraries, are ready.

On Kubuntu or Ubuntu, these requirements can be fulfilled by running:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential

On OpenSUSE, these requirements can be fulfilled by running:

    sudo zypper install gcc-g++ make

Run the following:

    ./configure
    make

Installation step (requires root password):

    sudo make install

Alternatively copy hammerjs executable to a directory in the PATH, e.g ~/bin.

Tip: For a faster initial build, install CMake 2.6 or later.
If system-wide CMake is available, the configure script will use it.
Otherwise it will download and build a local CMake.

On Kubuntu or Ubuntu, CMake can be installed using:
    sudo apt-get install cmake

On OpenSUSE, CMake can be installed using:
    sudo zypper install cmake

Windows
=======

Requirement: CMake 2.6 or later.
See www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html and install the binary MSI.
